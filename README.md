## Installation

You can run the code if you have Scala 3 installed. Clone the repository, navigate to the root, and run `sbt run`. Given the constants currently embedded in the code, this will run the example `simple` in `src/main/scala/test` and the output will be in an HTML file in `src/main/scala/test/out`.
